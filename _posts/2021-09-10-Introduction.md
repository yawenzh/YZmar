Welcome!

[Part to Whole - Global to Local](http://keanmgc.github.io/2021fall3yr-studio/)


## Definition of Home
##### -Working people of any age or newly graduated college students in urgent need of housing
##### -1 to 2 people
##### -The material is cheap, easy to move, disassemble and assemble
##### -Quiet, good lighting, lush vegetation
##### -Allow occupants to personalize their house: color, small facilities for pets, sports.etc
 
#### For social workers, home is a place to rest after busy and tense work. They can cultivate their interests, such as painting, video games, and pets. Nowadays, the idea of forming a big family is gradually weakening, and the demand for single person residence and double person residence is gradually increasing. Therefore, economical, and practical tiny houses have increasingly become the goal of people's house purchase. As a small volume residence, it needs complete functional areas and low cost to meet people's living needs.

#### Douglas fir was used to create the cabin's frame, which is supported on galvanised steel screw pile foundations, as well as the external wall studs and roof rafters. The window detailing allows the outer frames to be concealed both internally and externally and gives them a more streamlined appearance. The warm tones and textures of the wood, along with the exposed roof rafters that also act as acoustic baffles, help create a relaxing and quiet interior environment.

## Site
#### Jordan River Peace Labyrinth
Near to a park, a cluster site - a larger parcel where multiple residences could be located in a small planned 
development.
