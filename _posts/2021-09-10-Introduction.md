For social workers, home is a place to rest after busy and tense work. They can cultivate their interests, such as painting, video games, and pets. Nowadays, the idea of forming a big family is gradually weakening, and the demand for single person residence and double person residence is gradually increasing. Therefore, economical, and practical tiny houses have increasingly become the goal of people's house purchase. As a small volume residence, it needs complete functional areas and low cost to meet people's living needs.

Designed by Crosson Clarke Carnachan Architects, this movable hut measures just over 430 square foot. Built on an innovative sledge, the hut's facade can be opened up to reveal glazed doors or closed for protection against weather or when not in use.
