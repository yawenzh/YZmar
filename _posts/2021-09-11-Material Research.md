Hut on Sleds, Crosson Clarke Carnachan Architects, 2011
#### Located within a designated erosion zone on the Coromandel Peninsula, the house was designed as a mobile structure to satisfy a planning condition requiring that all buildings in the area be removable.

#### The hut is totally sustainable from its modest size to the use of timber in its cladding, structure, lining and joinery and from its worm tank waste system to the separate portable grey water tanks.

Timber Cabin, Crafted Works, 2018
#### Douglas fir was used to create the cabin's frame, which is supported on galvanised steel screw pile foundations, as well as the external wall studs and roof rafters. The window detailing allows the outer frames to be concealed both internally and externally and gives them a more streamlined appearance. The warm tones and textures of the wood, along with the exposed roof rafters that also act as acoustic baffles, help create a relaxing and quiet interior environment.

The BoHo Box Hop Container House, Emily & Seth
#### The two shipping containers (20 ft and 40 ft) were used in the construction, blended the modern container architecture with the small house concept. A smaller and totally extraordinary container house with a Clawfoot bathtub, large aft deck, 6-seater whirlpool and three viewing windows.

Hong Kong's newest housing solution, James Law
#### Aiming to ease the city's affordable housing problem, architect James Law has found a creative solution that converts concrete water pipes into 100-square-foot micro-living units. Called OPod, the tiny apartments are equipped with a shower, toilet, and smartphone lock, and can house one to two people. Additionally, the tube houses can also be stacked on one another between the cityâ€™s highrises to form modular communities.

## Site
#### Jordan River Peace Labyrinth
Near to a park, a cluster site - a larger parcel where multiple residences could be located in a small planned 
development.
