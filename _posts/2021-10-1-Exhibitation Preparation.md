##### Salt Lake City is a city full of young people（the largest proportion of the city’s population is in the 25 to 39 age group). Due to population growth and rapid economic growth, the demand for housing in this city has surged, resulting in a shortage of housing. In the future, long-term population and economic growth will lead to a rapid increase in housing prices in Salt Lake County. The housing market in Salt Lake City cannot keep up with demand, which has prompted many millennials and new residents to enter the rental market. Although many people want to own their own homes, affordability is an issue for young people who want to become homeowners. Therefore, economical, and practical tiny houses have increasingly become the goal of people's house purchase.

##### Mobile homes are good choices. They provide the benefits and comforts we want in people's housing at affordable prices. Not only this, but they are growing in popularity as a result of their simplicity and minimalist qualities. Especially young people would like to move their house to anywhere. Fields, the forests can be a place to stay on a weekend.
