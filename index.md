### About
Salt Lake City is a city full of young people. Due to population growth and rapid economic growth, the demand for housing in this city has surged, resulting in a shortage of housing. In the future, long-term population and economic growth will lead to a rapid increase in housing prices in Salt Lake County. The housing market in Salt Lake City cannot keep up with demand, which has prompted many millennials and new residents to enter the rental market. Although many people want to own their own homes, affordability is an issue for young people who want to become homeowners. Therefore, people need cheaper houses to meet housing demand.
